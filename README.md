In the features section you want to list all the features of your project. This is a great place to describe how each part of your site works. Its highly recommended to use screenshots here of all the features so the reader can 
easily identify the feature in question.

## Deployment Steps
Github Pages was used to deploy this live website. 

### Heroku
The steps taken were as follows:

1. From your Heroku Dashboard, create an app
2. Once created, add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:
    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`
3. Create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
4. From the _Deploy_ tab, you can then connect your GitHub account in the _Deployment method_ section.
5. Below that you will then be able to search for your repository and deploy your app.


### Cloning and forking
To view the cloning options available on Github:

1. Log in (or sign up) to [Github](https://github.com).
2. Find the repository for this project from [my profile](https://github.com/chl03rivs) in [night-owlzzz](https://github.com/chl03rivs).
3. Click on the blue **<> Code** button with the downward arrow.

If you wish to download a copy of this program and run it on your machine, you can do so  by choosing the **Download ZIP** options. Follow the usual steps of your machine to unzip the file and run it in your preferred software.

Note: your machine will need to have XX installed in order to run this project.

As this is a student project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full-Stack Development, forking is reserved to the assessment team. [GitHub documentation is available with the steps](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
