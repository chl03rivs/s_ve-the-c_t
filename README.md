# S_ve the c_t  

S_VE THE C_T is a terminal-based "hangman" game variation, with a dark(er) twist. 

To save the cat, the user has to guess a word/sentence, one letter at a time. Each mistake comes at a price...

## Features  
Hangman is a game in which players try to guess what letters are in a word before a complete picture of a man getting hanged appears. With each wrong guess, one element of the man (and the gruesome contraption that hangs him) is added.



In the features section you want to list all the features of your project. This is a great place to describe how each part of your site works. Its highly recommended to use screenshots here of all the features so the reader can 
easily identify the feature in question.


### Future Features
Here are a few of the ideas that I thought of while working on this project and may implement in the future, as I deepen my understanding of Python and broaden my programming skills.

**Quiz**
In order to make the game a bit more rewarding and educational, it would be interesting to have a higher difficulty level where we add a vocabulary check _after_ the user has guessed all the letters.

In this mode, victory can only be achieved by choosing the correct definition/synonym of the word.

Taking it up another notch, we could also have a level with a second language. Instead of simply being quizzed on the meaning of a word/sentence, we could be asked to translate it!

**Style the terminal**
In order to increase the replayability of the game and the user experience, I would like to implement a typing effect that would slow down the rate at which data is printed.

I looked into the possibility to trigger a screen clear using the OS module. Clearing the terminal after each stage of the game seems unpractical and also removes the option for the user to go over what was shared before.

Snce this did not satisfy my vision for the game, I want to look into other options to style the terminal and make it feel more like a conversation _with_ the user.

## Deployment Steps
Github Pages was used to deploy this live website. 

### Heroku
The steps taken were as follows:

1. From your Heroku Dashboard, create an app
2. Once created, add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:
    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`
3. Create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
4. From the _Deploy_ tab, you can then connect your GitHub account in the _Deployment method_ section.
5. Below that you will then be able to search for your repository and deploy your app.


### Cloning and forking
To view the cloning options available on Github:

1. Log in (or sign up) to [Github](https://github.com).
2. Find the repository for this project from [my profile](https://github.com/chl03rivs) in [night-owlzzz](https://github.com/chl03rivs).
3. Click on the blue **<> Code** button with the downward arrow.

If you wish to download a copy of this program and run it on your machine, you can do so  by choosing the **Download ZIP** options. Follow the usual steps of your machine to unzip the file and run it in your preferred software.

Note: your machine will need to have XX installed in order to run this project.

As this is a student project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full-Stack Development, forking is reserved to the assessment team. [GitHub documentation is available with the steps](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
